      Elephants are mammals of the family Elephantidae and the largest existing land animals. Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.
      Distinctive features of all elephants include a long trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin.
      The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight.
